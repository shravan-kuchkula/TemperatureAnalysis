In this notebook, we will learn to use R for time series analysis and forecasting. We will also learn, basic `time series models` :

* **White Noise (WN)**
* **Random Walk (RW)**
* **Autoregression (AR)**
* **Simple Moving Average (MA)**

## Exploring raw time series:

The most common first step when conducting time series analysis is to display your time series dataset in a visually intuitive format. The most useful way to view raw time series data in R is to use the `print()` command, which displays the Start, End, and Frequency of your data along with the observations.

Here, we will use the `Nile` dataset which is part of the `datasets` package, which is loaded by default. 


```{r}
print(Nile)
```


Another useful command for viewing time series data in R is the `length()` function, which tells you the total number of observations in your data.

```{r}
# List the number of observations in the Nile dataset
length(Nile)
```

## Basic time series plot
While simple commands such as print(), length(), head(), and tail() provide crucial information about your time series data, another very useful way to explore any data is to generate a plot.

In this exercise, you will plot the River Nile annual streamflow data using the plot() function. For time series data objects such as Nile, a Time index for the horizontal axis is typically included. From the previous exercise, you know that this data spans from 1871 to 1970, and horizontal tick marks are labeled as such. The default label of "Time" is not very informative. Since these data are annual measurements, you should use the label "Year". While you're at it, you should change the vertical axis label to "River Volume (1e9 m^{3})".

Additionally, it helps to have an informative title, which can be set using the argument main. For your purposes, a useful title for this figure would be "Annual River Nile Volume at Aswan, 1871-1970".

Finally, the default plotting type for time series objects is "l" for line. Connecting consecutive observations can help make a time series plot more interpretable. Sometimes it is also useful to include both the observations points as well as the lines, and we instead use "b" for both.

```{r}
# Plot the Nile data
plot(Nile)

# Plot the Nile data with xlab and ylab arguments
plot(Nile, xlab = "Year", ylab = "River Volume (1e9 m^{3})")

# Plot the Nile data with xlab, ylab, main, and type arguments

plot(Nile, xlab = "Year", ylab = "River Volume (1e9 m^{3})", main = "Annual River Nile Volume at Aswan, 1871-1970", type="b")
```
